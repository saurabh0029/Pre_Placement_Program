    "purposes: dimensionality reduction and translation invariance. Let's dive into each \n",
    "of these aspects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dimensionality Reduction:\n",
    "Pooling layers reduce the spatial dimensions (width and height) of the input volume,\n",
    "which helps in reducing the computational complexity of subsequent layers and \n",
    "controlling overfitting. By downsampling the feature maps, pooling layers extract\n",
    "the most important information while discarding some of the less relevant details.\n",
    "This process can be understood as a form of data compression.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pooling operation divides the input feature map into a set of non-overlapping\n",
    "regions (often called pooling windows or kernels) and applies a function to summarize\n",
    "the information within each region. The most common type of pooling is max pooling,\n",
    "where the maximum value within each region is taken as the output. Other variants include \n",
    "average pooling, which takes the average value, and L2-norm pooling, which computes the\n",
    "square root of the sum of squared values within each region.\n",
    "\n",
    "By reducing the spatial dimensions, pooling layers also contribute to controlling the\n",
    "model's sensitivity to the exact location of features in the input. This brings us to\n",
    "the next aspect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Translation Invariance:\n",
    "Pooling layers help achieve translation invariance, which means that the CNN's\n",
    "output should be the same regardless of the exact location of the features in \n",
    "the input. Invariance to translation is important because the spatial location\n",
    "of a feature can vary across different instances of an object or pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "By applying the pooling operation, the CNN can detect features at different spatial\n",
    "positions and still recognize them as the same. For example, if a particular feature, \n",
    "such as an edge or a texture pattern, is present in the top-left corner of an image or\n",
    "in the bottom-right corner, the pooling layer can still capture and highlight that feature\n",
    "by selecting the maximum value within the pooling window.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, pooling layers play a vital role in reducing the spatial dimensions of feature maps\n",
    "controlling overfitting, and promoting translation invariance in CNNs. By summarizing the\n",
    "information and discarding less relevant details, they contribute to more efficient and \n",
    "effective feature extraction, which is crucial for various computer vision tasks.\n"

    "\n",
    "Data Sparsity: Imbalanced datasets typically have fewer instances of the \n",
    "minority class, resulting in data sparsity. This scarcity can make it \n",
    "difficult for the model to learn representative patterns and generalize well.\n",
    "The model may struggle to identify the minority class instances correctly due \n",
    "to insufficient exposure during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Biased Decision Boundaries: Neural networks tend to learn decision boundaries \n",
    "that align with the majority class due to the imbalanced distribution. As a \n",
    "consequence, the decision boundaries become biased towards the majority class,\n",
    "making it challenging for the model to discriminate the minority class instances\n",
    "effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Incorrect Optimization: The optimization process of neural networks aims to \n",

    "dominated by the majority class, leading to suboptimal learning. The model may\n",
    "converge to a solution that simply predicts the majority class for all instances,\n",
    "as it minimizes the loss without properly addressing the minority class.\n",
